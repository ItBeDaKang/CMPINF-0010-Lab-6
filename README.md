### What Our Program Does
Our program, found in "Gittest.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook form, takes both a name and an integer as input. It produces output in the form "<name>, this number is <greater than/less than/equal to> 100" - in other words, the program prints out a string that addresses the inputted name and informs them of how their integer compares in value to 100.
